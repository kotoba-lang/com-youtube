(ns youtube.client
  "Portable core for talking to the YouTube Data API v3 upload surface --
  OAuth2 refresh-token exchange + one injectable HTTP boundary for every
  youtube.* namespace in this library.

  Extracted/re-ported from `kotoba-lang/youtube-upload` (a Python client
  already extracted from `ai-gftd-project-yukkuri`'s
  `lg_yukkuri/graphs/upload_youtube.py`). That Python package's own README
  explicitly recommends wrapping rather than rewriting for Clojure
  consumers -- this repo does the rewrite anyway (explicit request), so it
  re-derives the same request/response shapes from the original httpx
  client's behavior (`kotoba-lang/youtube-upload/src/youtube_upload/client.py`)
  rather than guessing at the API.

  **Every namespace here runs on both Clojure and ClojureScript** (JSON,
  form encoding, byte handling and the multipart body are all reader-
  conditional; see youtube.portable-test for the cljs half). Until
  2026-08-11 every effectful fn was wrapped in `#?(:clj ...)`, so a library
  that advertised `.cljc` portability existed on one runtime only, and nbb
  operators had to shell out to a separate Python client to publish.

  The transport is the one thing that is not shared: `jvm-http-fn`
  (java.net.http) is the JVM default, and **cljs has no default on purpose**
  -- every function is written against a *synchronous* http-fn and JS has no
  synchronous fetch, so a cljs default could only be a lie that hands back a
  promise where the code expects a response map. cljs callers inject their
  own (nbb operators drive `curl` through execFileSync). The convention is
  the same `{:url :method :headers :body} -> {:status :body}` one
  `kotoba-lang/com-cloudflare` uses, so every namespace is testable with a
  stub, never only against a live account. `:body` may be a String or an
  opaque byte buffer (JVM byte[] / JS Uint8Array) for video/image/SRT bytes.

  Credentials: never held or defaulted by this library. Callers pass
  `:client-id`/`:client-secret`/`:refresh-token`/`:access-token` explicitly
  (or read them from wherever their own env/secret store keeps them) --
  mirrors `ai-gftd-project-yukkuri/docs/youtube-upload-setup.md`'s policy
  that these are operator-injected, never code-held."
